# Meet-up Event Planner

Project #1 for the [Udacity Senior Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/senior-web-developer-nanodegree--nd802)

## Requirements

You do not need to create a functioning back-end or save user information. Only the form components themselves and their performance will be evaluated.

1. You do not need to create a real back-end or save user information, but the app must provide a form for users to create an account. Account creation should include, but is not limited to:

	- Name
	- Email address
	- Secure password (with character and length requirements)
	- Optional public biographical information (such as employer, job title, birthday, etc)

2.  The app should allow users to create a new event. Each event should, at a minimum, allow a user to set:

	- Name of the event
	- Type of the event (birthday party, conference talk, wedding, etc.)
	- Event host (could be an individualâ€™s name or an organization)
	- Event start date and time
	- Event end date and time
	- Guest list
	- Location
	- Optional message to the guests with additional information about the event

3.  The app should display events that have been created.
